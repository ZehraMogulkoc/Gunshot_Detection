# IoT Based Gunshot Detection 
This repository focuses on the development and deployment of a gunshot detection system powered by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The core model architecture and training procedures are meticulously detailed in the prediction_model.ipynb notebook. The report of the IoT project is available on the **Report_GN.pdf document**. 

# Dataset Augmentation
To bolster the efficacy and accuracy of our detection model, we enriched the renowned Urban8K dataset with an additional 900 gunshot sound samples. This augmentation strategy facilitated the creation of a binary dataset, enabling the model to distinguish between gunshot and ambient sounds effectively.
